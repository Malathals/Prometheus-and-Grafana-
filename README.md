# ðŸ“Š Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana on Kubernetes

This project deploys a simple monitoring stack on Kubernetes using **Helm**. It includes:

- **Prometheus** for collecting and storing metrics.
- **Node Exporter** for gathering node-level system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, load).
- **Kube State Metrics** for exposing Kubernetes object metrics (pods, deployments, nodes).
- **Grafana** for visualizing metrics with pre-built and custom dashboards.

Together, this stack provides real-time insights into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster and its nodes.
